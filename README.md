# SBSC_VisualNovelMessengerTypeUnityProject

  A unity project for the inkle 2021 game jam, this has the bare bones of a messenger type game that can make and send messages based off your ink file. I had trouble finding any tutorials or github projects that were similar to games like Mystic Messenger or the Phone UI of Nainai's Recipe, so I decided to release the project files for others to reference it. It lacks a few features usually found in Visual Novels and in Messenger Type games such as conversation lists, recieving messages automatically, skipping text but it does the job.
